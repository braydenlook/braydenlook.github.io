Hello, I'm a former electrical engineer getting a Master's in Statistics at Colorado State University.  I have interests in sports statistics (particularly the NBA), in estimation, and in signal processing, but I find value in looking at problems from the persective of other fields and disciplines, rather than specializing in one area.
