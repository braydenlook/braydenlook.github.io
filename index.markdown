Welcome to my webzone. I'm a former electrical engineer and current graduate student in the Statistics department at Colorado State University. I have interests in a lot of things individually, but spend a lot of time thinking about how different areas of study relate to each other. Recently that has been the intersection of functional analysis and probability theory, as well as the intersection between information theory and (typically frequentist) estimation.
