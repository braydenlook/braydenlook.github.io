### Intro

The Miami Heat are the first team in a long time to make the NBA finals with a negative point differential in the regular season. To get there, the Heat finished off the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had a league leading net rating of +6.5. I was curious what the biggest NBA upsets were (in terms of net rating) and how the Heat stacked up against them. First, let's quickly review net rating.

### Net Rating Refresher

Net rating is the average amount of points per 100 possessions that a team has scored against its opponents. For example, suppose a team has played 1,000 possessions (roughly 9 games worth of possessions) and that their offense has scored 1142 points and their defense has given up 1095 points. That team would have an offensive rating of 114.2, a defensive rating of 109.5, and a net rating of 114.2-109.5 = +4.7. Why would we care about net rating and why would we care about upsets by net rating vs seeding? The reason is that net rating is typically a better predictor of future success than wins, and is thus a better way of "ranking" teams. The intuitive reason is simple: beating a team by 23 points is better than beating a team by 1 point. Wins don't take into account how badly you're beating a team (or how badly you're getting beaten.)

Here's a table to give some (very rough) perspective to net ratings:

| Net Rating (Expected Wins)      | Interpretation | Example Team (Net Rating)    |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| >+10 (>65)     | All time great       | 2016-17 Warriors (+11.6)  |
| +7-10 (58-65)   | Strong title contender        | 2013-14 Spurs (+8.1)      |
| +4-7 (51-58)   | Average title contender      | 2011-12 Thunder (+6.5)      |
| <+4 (<51)   | Weak title contender        | 2006-07 Cavaliers (+4.2)      |

Generally, every extra point of net rating translates to about 2.5 wins, and a team with a net rating of 0 is considered to be an average team. We would expect an average team to have a record of 41-41, so a team with a +10 net rating is expected to be ~25 wins above average, which is about 66 wins. (figure out how to put footnotes and mention the 73 win warriors)

### Ranking Upsets

With all that in mind, let's try to put this Heat upset into perspective. The Heat had a net rating of -0.3 and the Celtics had a net rating of +6.5, so the **upset differential** was -6.8. Since 1953, the farthest back we have point differential data for, there have only been 8 instances of an upset differential of -6 or below. Here they are:


| Year (Round)     | Team (Nrtg) | Team (Nrtg)    | Upset Differential | Notes |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: | | |
| 1989 (1)  | Chicago Bulls (+1.5)       	| Cleveland Cavaliers (+7.7)      | -6.2 | Jordan's series winner takes place, Bulls eliminated by the Pistons next round |
| 1994 (1) | Denver Nuggets (+1.5)        | Seattle SuperSonics (+9.5)      | -7.0 | In the following round, the Nuggets almost pull off a 3-0 comeback against the Jazz|
| 1995 (1) | Houston Rockets (+2.2)      	| Utah Jazz (+8.6)      		  | -6.4 | |
| 1995 (1) | Los Angeles Lakers (-0.2)    | Seattle SuperSonics (+8.5)      | -8.7 | Seattle gets embarrassed two years in row, Lakers elimintaed by the Spurs next round |
| 2007 (1)  | Golden State Warriors (-0.3)    | Dallas Mavericks (+8.0)      | -8.3 | The "We Believe" team |
| 2011 (1)  | Atlanta Hawks (-0.9)    | Orlando Magic (+5.9)      			  | -6.8 | |
| 2018 (2)  | Cleveland Cavaliers (+1.0)    |  Toronto Raptors (+7.9)        | -6.9 | "Two points isn't two points" |
| 2020 (2)  | Miami Heat (+3.0)    | Milwaukee Bucks (+9.5)     			  | -6.5 | |
| 2023 (3)  | Miami Heat (-0.3)    | Boston Celtics (+6.5)      			  | -6.8 | |


There are a couple things of note here: one is that there are no major upsets stretching nearly 4 decades from the 50s until 1989. The other is that 5 of the 8 instances have occurred since 2007. 3 of the 8 instances have occurred in the last 6 years. This might be especially surprising since the first round (which has the most potential for major upsets) changed from a best of 5 format to a best of 7 format in 2003. You might assume that a less "random" format would lessen the chance of an upset. My guess is that for the former, the league was so small that it was difficult for a team to dominate the others so much during the regular season. As the league expanded to more teams, there might be more opportunity for extremes: extremely dominant and extremely weak teams. More recently, I would guess that the rise of three pointers has made the playoffs much more random.
