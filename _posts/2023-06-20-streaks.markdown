On March 29th, 2023, Russell Westbrook, a remarkably shitty three-point shooter, made five three-point shots in a row. I was curious how rare of an event this was and wanted to see if I could come up with a formula for the probability of observing a streak of 1s of some length $$M$$ in a sequence of 1s and 0s of total length $$L$$. A while back, I thought about a similar problem and figured there was a simple closed form solution for such a problem, but it turned out to be [pretty disgusting](https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/07/q-whats-the-chance-of-getting-a-run-of-k-successes-in-n-bernoulli-trials-why-use-approximations-when-the-exact-answer-is-known/). I started by opting to let $$p=0.5$$ and solve it as a simpler combinatorics problem. 

The process was somewhat interesting and did not go in the same direction as the solution I found online, so I wanted to share that thought process. Also, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers#Similar_integer_sequences#:~:text=The%20probability%20that%20no) and [Wolfram's](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoinTossing.html) answer to the problem (for the restricted $$p = 0.5$$) seems to be wrong.

### Notation

Consider the set of all length $$L$$ sequences of 1s and 0s. Define $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ to be this set. Call each member of $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ an $$L$$-sequence. How many $$L$$-sequences in $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ contain a *streak* of 1's of **at least** length $$M$$? Here we define a *streak* of length $$M$$ to be $$M$$ consecutive 1's.

For example, let $$L = 4$$, $$M = 2$$. There are $$2^4 = 16$$ sequences in $$\mathcal{A}_4$$, and 8 of them contain an $$M$$-streak (highlighted green):

<p align="center">

</p>

Denote the number of $$M$$-streaks in an $$L$$-sequence as $$f(L, M)$$. Hence, $$f(4, 2) = 8$$. How do we find a formula for $$f$$? 

### Boundary Points

First, let's consider possible values for $$f(L, M)$$, starting with $$L$$. Clearly it doesn't make sense for $$L$$ to be less than zero, and we can see that $$\mathcal{A}_0 = \{\varnothing\}$$, so define $$f(L, M) = 0$$ for $$L \le 0 \,\, \forall \,\, M$$. 

For $$M$$, we should also require it to be greater than $$0$$, but we should make sure to restrict $$f$$ to cases where $$L \ge M$$; clearly there are no streaks of length 6 in a sequence of length 5.

What about when $$M = 0$$? How many streaks of length $$0$$ are there in $$\mathcal{A}_L$$? There are two reasonable options: either $$f(L, 0) = 2^L$$, or $$f(L, 0) = 0$$. Let's go with the former and assume that every sequence in $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ has a zero streak.

Thus, $$f(L, M)$$ is defined for $$L = 1, 2,...$$ and $$M = 0, 1, 2, ..., L$$. Otherwise, it's zero.

### M=2 Approach

Before jumping into the formula, let's gain some intuition for the type of problem this is by fixing $$M = 2$$ and seeing what occurs when $$L$$ changes. Let's think about starting with $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ and seeing how we get to $$\mathcal{A}_{L+1}$$ by 'growing' our sequences:

<p align="center">
    <img width="400" src="/images/streaks2.png">
</p>

If we fix $$M=2$$ and let $$L = 1, 2, 3, 4$$ we get $$f(1, 2) = 0$$, $$f(2, 2) = 1$$, $$f(3, 2) = 3$$, and $$f(4, 2) = 8$$. The diagram above where we 'grow' our sequences can illuminate a few things for us.

First notice that whatever $$M$$-streaks we have in $$\mathcal{A}_L$$, we also have in $$\mathcal{A}_{L+1}$$. In fact, we can say that we will always have at least twice as many streaks in $$\mathcal{A}_{L+1}$$ as we do in $$\mathcal{A}_{L}$$, because as we 'grow' our sequences, we take our original sequences and add a 0 to it and a 1.

To explain further, take a look at $$\mathcal{A}_2$$. We have only one with a streak, $$[1, 1]$$. When we go from $$\mathcal{A}_2$$ to $$\mathcal{A}_3$$, we 'grow' our sequences by adding a $$0$$ to the front of them all, and then by adding a $$1$$ to the front of them all. Thus, we know that we will have $$[0, 1, 1]$$ and $$[1, 1, 1]$$ as streaks in $$\mathcal{A}_3$$.

This is immensely helpful to us, because now we can have some semblance of a formula for $$f$$:

$$f(L, M) = 2f(L-1, M) + \text{something}$$

Our goal now is to figure out the 'something' part. So far, we know that a streak in $$\mathcal{A}_{L}$$ will turn into 2 streaks in $$\mathcal{A}_{L+1}$$. If we keep thinking about this in terms of 'growing' sequences, what do we need for a sequence to go from not containing a streak to containing one? In the $$M=2$$ case illustrated above, we can see that a sequence without a streak will turn into one if it has a leading 1.

For example, in $$\mathcal{A}_2$$, we have $$[0, 0]$$, $$[0, 1]$$ and $$[1, 0]$$ as non-streaks. When we 'grow' our sequences, $$[0, 0]$$ will turn into $$[0, 0, 0]$$ and $$[1, 0, 0]$$, $$[0, 1]$$ will turn into $$[0, 0, 1]$$ and $$[1, 0, 1]$$, and $$[1, 0]$$ will turn into $$[0, 1, 0]$$ and $$[1, 1, 0]$$. So only $$[1, 0]$$ turned into a streak.

What can we take away from this? Clearly, if we take a sequence with no streaks and add a 0 to it, it will not suddenly have a streak. If we add a 1 to it, we will get a streak IF the sequence already had a leading 1. Let's label these sequences as 'almosts' and color them yellow:
  
<p align="center">
    <img width="400" src="/images/streaks3.png">
</p>

Now let's count how many 'almosts' we have for each $$L$$ and $$M$$, and denote this quantity as $$a(L, M)$$:

$$
\begin{align*}
    a(1, 2) &= 1\\[10pt]
    a(2, 2) &= 1\\[10pt]
    a(3, 2) &= 2\\[10pt]
    a(4, 2) &= 3\\[10pt]
    a(5, 2) &= 5
\end{align*}
$$

This sequence seems familiar, and indeed it is. If we keep checking $$a(L, 2)$$ for higher $$L$$ values, we'll find that it is the Fibonacci sequence. If we do this for other values of $$M$$, we'll find that $$a(L, M)$$ follows a generalized $$M^{th}$$ order Fibonacci sequence, where we add the previous $$M$$ values. 

In other words, $$a(L, 2)$$ can be represented as

$$a(L, 2) = a(L-1, 2) + a(L-2, 2)$$

$$a(L, 3)$$ can be represented as

$$a(L, 3) = a(L-1, 3) + a(L-2, 3) + a(L-3, 3)$$

and so on, with initial conditions that $$a(0, M) = a(1, M) = ... = a(M-2, M) = 0$$

We can now say that we have a formula for $$f$$:

$$f(L, M) = 2f(L-1, M) + a(L-1, M)$$

In (mostly) English, it says that the number of $$M$$-streaks in $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ is equal to 2 times the number of $$M$$-streaks in $$\mathcal{A}_{L-1}$$ plus the number of 'almost' $$M$$-streaks in $$\mathcal{A}_{L-1}$$. How does this help us if we still don't have explicit closed form expressions for $$f$$ OR $$a$$? Let's try to expand our $$f$$ recursion by plugging in $$f$$ into itself on the right hand side:

$$
\begin{align*}
    f(L, M) &= 2f(L-1, M) + a(L-1, M)\\[10pt]
    &= 2[2f(L-2, M) + a(L-2, M)] + a(L-1, M)\\[10pt]
    &= 2[2[2f(L-3, M) + a(L-3, M)] + a(L-2, M)] + a(L-1, M)\\[10pt]
    &= ... \\[10pt]
    &= a(L-1, M) + 2a(L-2, M) + 2^2a(L-3, M) + 2^3a(L-4, M) + ...
\end{align*}
$$

It seems like we're no closer to our goal because we still have no closed form solution for $$a$$. What we can do to solve this is use *generating functions*. Electrical engineers may see analogs to z-transforms, while statisticians may see analogs to MGFs. First, clean things up by making $$L, M$$ subscripts instead of arguments, and then drop $$M=2$$ since we're keeping it constant. That is, let $$a(L, 2) = a_{L, 2} = a_L$$. Then we define

$$A(x) = \sum_{L=0}^{\infty} a_Lx^L = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ...$$

That is, we define the sequence $$\{a_L\}_{L=0}^{\infty}$$ to be the coefficients for some unknown infinite power series, $$A(x)$$. Then take the recursion formula we would like to solve,

$$
\begin{align*}
    a_L &= a_{L-1} + a_{L-2}
\end{align*}
$$

multiply both sides by $$x^L$$, and sum over $$L$$ from 2 to $$\infty$$,

$$
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{L = 2}^{\infty} a_Lx^{L} &= \sum_{L = 2}^{\infty} a_{L-1}x^{L} + \sum_{L = 2}^{\infty} a_{L-2}x^{L}\\[10pt]
    [a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + ...] &= [a_1x^2 + a_2x^3 + ...] + [a_0x^2 + a_1x^3 + ...]\\[10pt]
    [A(x) - a_0 - a_1x] &= [x(A(x) - a_0)] + [x^2A(x)]\\[10pt]
    [A(x) - x] &= [xA(x)] + [x^2A(x)]\\[10pt]
    \implies A(x) &= \frac{x}{1-x-x^2}
\end{align*}
$$

In the second-to-last line we use the initial conditions established earlier to say that $$a_0 = 0$$ and $$a_1 = 1$$. If generating functions are new to you, what we just did might seem like magic. But not only that, it might seem like useless magic; we now have a function in terms of $$x$$... so what?

By the way that we defined $$A(x)$$ originally, we know that $$a_L$$ will be the $$L^{th}$$ coefficient of the infinite power series $$A(x)$$. So all we have to do is expand $$A(x)$$ to find an expression for $$a_L$$.

To expand $$A(x)$$, we would do a partial fraction decomposition and find that

$$
\begin{align*}
    A(x) = \frac{x}{1-x-x^2} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\frac{1}{1-x(1+\sqrt{5}/2)} - \frac{1}{1-x(1-\sqrt{5}/2)} \right]\\[10pt]
    &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\frac{1}{1-x\phi} - \frac{1}{1-x\psi} \right]
\end{align*}
$$

Where in the last line we let $$\phi = (1+\sqrt{5}/2)$$ and $$\psi = (1-\sqrt{5}/2)$$

Then we use the general fact that 

$$\frac{1}{1-xr} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (rx)^n$$

To say that 

$$a_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\phi^L - \psi^L \right]$$

Now that we have an expression for $$a_L$$, we need to go back to our original formula to find an expression for $$f_L$$ (again, let's stick with $$M=2$$ for now and continue to omit the $$M$$ subscript/argument). Let's also rewrite it so that we're solving for the $$(L+1)^{th}$$ term instead of the $$L^{th}$$. This will make notation a tad easier for us later. Then we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
    f_{L+1} &= a_{L} + 2a_{L-1} + 2^2a_{L-2} + ... + 2^{L}a_0
\end{align*}
$$

Here we're going to take another leap that is not obvious, but will be stated as if it was. First, some notation: if $$A(x)$$ is a power series whose coefficients are some sequence $$\{a_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$$, denote such a relationship as $$A \leftrightarrow \{a_n\}$$. Then if 

$$A \leftrightarrow \{a_n\},$$

and

$$B \leftrightarrow \{b_n\},$$

then

$$AB \leftrightarrow \{\sum_{n=0}^j a_nb_{j-n}\}_{j=0}^{\infty}$$

The notation is dense, but the meaning is simple: this says is that if we multiply two power series together, $$A$$ and $$B$$, the coefficients of the new power series, $$AB$$, are just a convolution of the coefficients of $$A$$ and $$B$$. (Another parallel to z-transforms and MGFs).

The expression we have for $$f_{L+1}$$ above is indeed a convolution of two sequences, where $$A(x)$$ is the power series function we defined earlier for the Fibonacci sequence, and $$B(x)$$ is the sequence $$\{2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3,...\}$$. 

Now all that needs to be done is to repeat the process and solve for some expression for the power series of $$f_L$$ which we will denote as $$F(x)$$

$$
\begin{align*}
    F(x) = A(x)B(x) &= \frac{x}{1-x-x^2}\frac{1}{1-2x}\\[10pt]
    &= \frac{2}{1-2x} + \frac{x + 2}{1-x-x^2}\\[10pt]
    &= \frac{2}{1-2x} + \frac{2}{1-x-x^2} + \frac{x}{1-x-x^2}\\[10pt]
    &= 2B + \frac{2A}{x} + A
\end{align*}
$$

Let's pause to interpret this equation. This equation is telling us that the $$(L+1)^{th}$$ coefficient of the power series $$F(x)$$ is the sum of the $$L^{th}$$ coefficients of the power series $$2B$$, $$2A/x$$, and $$A$$. Thus, if we can find closed form representations of each of these individual sequences, we're done. 

We already know $$A$$; we solved for that earlier. $$B$$ is straightforward: the $$L^{th}$$ value is just $$2^L$$, and so the $$L^{th}$$ value of $$2B$$ is $$2^{L+1}$$. What is $$A/x$$? Let's write out some terms to check:

$$
\begin{align*}
    A(x) &= a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ...\\[10pt]
    \implies \frac{A(x)}{x} &= a_0/x + a_1 + a_2x + ...\\[10pt]
    &= a_1 + a_2x + a_3x^2 + ...
\end{align*}
$$

Since $$a_0$$ is defined to be 0 when $$M=2$$, $$A(x)/x$$ is just $$A(x)$$ moved up one term! Thus, we can write this as:

$$f_{L+1} = 2^{L+1} - 2a_{L+1} - a_{L}$$

Where $$a_L$$ is the $$L^{th}$$ term of the Fibonacci sequence, given by

$$a_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\phi^L - \psi^L \right]$$

Finally, we can simplify by using properties of the Fibonacci sequence:

$$
\begin{align*}
    f_{L+1} &= 2^{L+1} - 2a_{L+1} - a_{L}\\[10pt]
    &= 2^{L+1} - \underbrace{(a_{L+1} + a_{L})}_{a_{L+2}} - a_{L+1}\\[10pt]
    &= 2^{L+1} - \underbrace{(a_{L+2} + a_{L+1})}_{a_{L+3}}\\[10pt]
    &= 2^{L+1} - a_{L+3}\\[10pt]
	\implies f_{L} &= 2^{L} - a_{L+2}
\end{align*}
$$

Note something interesting about this: The number of total sequences in $$\mathcal{A}_{L}$$ is $$2^L$$, and so this tells us that $$a_{L+2}$$ is exactly the number of sequences in $$\mathcal{A}_L$$ that do *not* contain a 2-streak.

### Formula for any M

Let's try to generalize what we just did for the $$M=2$$ case. Note that our generic formula for $$f$$ still holds:

$$f_{L+1, M} = a_{L, M} + 2a_{L-1, M} + 2^2a_{L-2, M} + ... + 2^{L}a_{0, M}$$

But we now have an extra subscript to acknowledge. Note that our $$a$$ coefficients are no longer the Fibonacci coefficients, but the more general $$M^{th}$$ order Fibonacci coefficients. Thus, our first step is to find the power series, $$A_M(x)$$, that represents these coefficients. The work is tedious, so we'll skip to the end and state directly that the power series for an $$M^{th}$$ order Fibonacci sequence is given by

$$A_{M}(x) = \frac{x^{M-1}}{1-x-x^2-...-x^{M}}$$

Since we have the same general equation for $$f$$ as before, we know again that we have a convolution between $$A_M(x)$$ and $$B(x)$$, where $$B(x)$$ is the same sequence of powers of 2 as before. Again skipping tedious algebra, we find this relation:

$$
\begin{align*}
    F(x) = A_M(x)B(x) &= \frac{x^{M-1}}{p(x)} \frac{1}{1-2x}\\[10pt]
    &= \frac{2}{1-2x} - \frac{2}{p(x)} - \frac{2x}{p(x)} - ... - \frac{2x^{M-1}}{p(x)} - \frac{x^{M-1}}{p(x)}\\[10pt]
    &= 2B - 2A_M/x^{M-1} - 2A_M/x^{M-2} - ... - 2A_M/x - A_M
\end{align*}
$$

Where $$p(x) = 1 - x - x^2 - ... - x^M$$. 

Following the same procedure as before, we find a similar formula:

$$
\begin{align*}
    f_{L+1, M} &= 2^{L+1} - 2a_{L+(M-1), M} - 2a_{L+(M-1)-1, M} - ... - 2a_{L+1, M} - a_{L, M}\\[10pt]
    &= 2^{L+1} - \underbrace{(a_{L+(M-1), M} + ... + a_{L+1, M})}_{a_{L+M}} - (a_{L+(M-1), M} + ... + a_{L+1, M} + a_{L, M})\\[10pt]
    &= 2^{L+1} - \underbrace{(a_{L+M} + a_{L+(M-1), M} + ... + a_{L+1, M} + a_{L, M})}_{a_{L+M+1}}\\[10pt]
    &= 2^{L+1} - a_{L+M+1, M}\\[10pt]
	\implies f_{L, M} &= 2^{L} - a_{L+M, M}
\end{align*}
$$

Now we need to find a formula for the $$L^{th}$$ coefficient for an $$M^{th}$$ order Fibonacci sequence. 

We'll look at a way to find this in a more clever way in the next post, but for now we'll take Wikipedia's word for it that the $$L^{th}$$ coefficient of an $$M^{th}$$ order Fibonacci sequence is the integer nearest to

$$a_{L, M} = \frac{r^{L-1}(r-1)}{(M+1)r - 2M},$$

where $$r$$ is the root of $$x + x^{-M} = 2$$ closest to 2. So even though we have a "closed form", we still need to numerically solve for a root and then round the equation to get our final answer.

Interestingly, Wikipedia's solution to the same problem seems to be incorrect. They state that the number of streaks for any M is 

$$2^{L} - a_{L+2, M},$$

which only holds for $$M=2$$.

In the next post, we'll look into an alternate way of solving this problem from a different perspective, as well as extending that method to cover the generic $$p$$ case.
